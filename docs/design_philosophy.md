# Design Philosophy

NextOS follows strict engineering principles:

- Minimalism by default

- Explicit configuration

- Reproducible builds

- Measured performance optimization

- Security by reduction of attack surface

- Clear separation between build system and runtime system

- NextOS does not aim to replicate existing distributions.
It aims to understand and refine the OS stack.
